Diamond elastic constants by energy–strain (RELAXED-ION) in QE
=================================================================
- This set uses calculation='relax' with fixed strained cells (cell_dofree='none').
- After each run, take the FINAL total energy for the fitted curves.
- Create CSVs hydro.csv, ortho.csv, shear.csv with columns: delta,energy_density (GPa)
